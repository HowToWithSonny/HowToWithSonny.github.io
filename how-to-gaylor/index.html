      <p>This page is dedicated to all the coded messages, hidden glances, and color schemes that made us raise our eyebrows and whisper, “Wait… is that a reference?”</p>

      <p>From lavender hazes to friendship bracelets, from secret lyrics to mirrored body language, here begins an archive of moments where Taylor Swift’s work intersects — intentionally or not — with queer culture, symbolism, and speculation.</p>

      <p>Start here:</p>

      <h2>🎬 You Need To Calm Down</h2>
      <p>A riot of rainbow colors, queer cameos, and direct references to LGBTQ+ acceptance, this MV is the most overt example of Swift’s “allyship era.” But is that all there is to it?</p>

    <section class="card" id="lavender-haze">
      <h2>🌫 Lavender Haze</h2>
      <p>The term “lavender” has long roots in queer history — from lavender marriages to lavender scares. This dreamy, violet-toned video reclaims softness and secrecy in curious ways.</p>

    <section class="card" id="look-what-you-made-me-do">
      <h2>👀 Look What You Made Me Do</h2>
      <p>Featuring multiple Taylors confronting each other, breaking out of cages, and smashing mirrors — this one could be about reputation, but could also be about identity, fragmentation, and performance.</p>
