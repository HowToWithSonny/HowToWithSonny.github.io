# Welcome to My Blog!

# How to with Sonny

I didn’t mean to make a website.

But I needed a place to gather all the theories, obsessions, glitter, and half-finished sentences I was too afraid to say out loud.  
A place where the Gaylor theory makes sense, where math feels like a love language, and where applying for grad school feels just a little less like Defying Gravity and a little more like joining the Pink Pony Club.

This site is a collection of small attempts —  
To understand Taylor’s music like sacred text.  
To survive modern algebra with emotions intact.  
To apply for a master's degree while secretly choreographing a routine under neon lights.

Every page starts with “How to…”  
Not because I know how — but because I’m learning, like you, how to keep dancing anyway.

You don’t have to take off your glitter at the door.

# How to with Sonny

我不是故意做这个网站的。

只是我需要一个地方，收纳那些关于 Taylor 的理论、数学的崩溃、霓虹灯下的幻想，还有我始终没能说出口的句子。  
一个 Gaylor 是常识、情绪可以写进函数、研究生申请像极了逆风飞翔的地方——  
一个能让我在《Defying Gravity》的高空与《Pink Pony Club》的舞池之间自由摆荡的空间。

这个网站是一些不成熟的尝试：
- 尝试像读神谕一样解读流行歌词
- 尝试带着完整的情绪学完现代代数
- 尝试一边填网申表格一边在心里跳着小马俱乐部的独舞

每一篇都从 “How to...” 开始，  
不是因为我知道怎么做，而是因为我还在努力练习继续跳下去的勇气。

欢迎你来，不需要卸下你的亮片。
